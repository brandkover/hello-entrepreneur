Displays inspiring quotes from great entrepreneurs in your admin dashboard. A modern and secure version of Hello Dolly.

== Description ==

Hello Entrepreneur is a tribute to the classic "Hello Dolly" plugin, but reimagined for founders, creators, and business owners.

Instead of song lyrics, this plugin randomly displays a motivational quote from references such as Steve Jobs, Henry Ford, Elon Musk, or Seth Godin at the top of your WordPress dashboard.

**Features:**

*   **Zero Configuration:** Activate and go.
*   **Modern Code:** Developed following current standards (Namespaces, Singleton, Escaping).
*   **Responsive:** Unlike other clones, this plugin adapts perfectly to mobile devices, centering the text so it doesn’t interfere with the interface.
*   **Lightweight:** Does not load unnecessary scripts or affect your site’s speed.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `hello-entrepreneur` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your server.
2. Activate the plugin from the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. You will see an inspiring quote in the top right of your admin dashboard.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I add my own quotes? =
Yes, you can easily edit the text array inside the main class in the PHP file.

= Does this affect my website frontend? =
No. The code only runs in the admin area (`is_admin()`), so it has no impact on what your visitors see.

== Screenshots ==

1. The motivational quote appearing on the dashboard (desktop version).
2. Responsive view on mobile devices.
